- Short summary of A.I.

Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence is a form of intelligence that does not have a           biological foundation, meaning its origin is of scientific and mathematic networks. Artificial intelligence – in advanced state – mimics parts of the human brain and is potentially capable of complex- problem solving, making interactions between other systems and human beings and making predictions.

- Definition of A.I. in games

Game A.I. is not the same as A.I. that is used academically. The A.I. in games is based on concrete details of the gaming environment, which is part of the subsystem, containing feature and schedule revision. The goal of A.I. in computer games is not to compute the most optimal behavior for winning against the player. Instead, the outcome should be as believable and fun as possible. 

- Examples of first usage + ‘simple’ usage (‘dumb’ AI's)

→ Pong, Chess, later usage in Tamagotchi


- Example of high-end usage (e.g. Skyrim)
- Future



# Literature (Deanna)

Ik gooi het gewoon in hetzelfde document haha mss heb jij er ook nog wat aan

**What is machine learning?**
Machine learning is the idea that there are generic algorithms that can tell you something interesting about a set of data without you having to write any custom code specific to the problem. Instead of writing code, you feed data to the generic algorithm and it builds its own logic based on the data.

**Machine learning:** an umbrella term covering lots of kinds of generic algorithms.

**Classification algorithm:** can put data into different groups. Can be used for different purposes; it’s fed different training data so it comes up with different classification logic.

## Two kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms:
****- Supervised learning
****- Unsupervised learning


## Supervised learning:

Using the training data to predict the prices of other [houses].
You knew the answer to the problem and could work backwards from there to figure out the logic.

![Oh no! A devious student erased the arithmetic symbols from the teacher’s answer key!](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*SihYXaJQS3T6tOwqJ6fzPw.png)


You are letting the computer work out that relationship for you. And once you know what math was required to solve this specific set of problems, you could answer to any other problem of the same type!





## Unsupervised learning:

What if you didn’t know the sale price for each [house]? 
This is kind of like someone giving you a list of numbers on a sheet of paper and saying “I don’t really know what these numbers mean but maybe you can figure out if there is a pattern or grouping or something — good luck!”

What to do with this data? e.g.

- Automatically identify different market segments in your data.
- Automatically identify any outlier houses that were way different than everything else.
